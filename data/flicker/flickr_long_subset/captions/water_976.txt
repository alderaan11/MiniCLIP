A young girl in a bright pink jacket splashes through a large puddle on the sidewalk, her eyes fixed on the path ahead as she tries to avoid getting soaked. The puddle stretches across most of the width of the walkway, reflecting the grey sky above and creating a miniature mirror effect. A few droplets of water sparkle on the girl's jacket as she steps out of the puddle, her smile indicating that she's more excited than annoyed by the unexpected splashing.
