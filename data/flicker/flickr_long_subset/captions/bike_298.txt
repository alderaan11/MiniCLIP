A rider clad in colorful biking gear zooms down a steeply inclined ramp, their bike's wheels making a blur as they navigate the course with ease. The ramp is set amidst a vibrant festival atmosphere, with cheering crowds and music filling the air. To one side of the ramp, a cluster of other bikes are on display, each one decorated with elaborate designs and lights that catch the sunlight in dazzling patterns.
