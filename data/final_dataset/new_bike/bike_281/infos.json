    "caption": "A young boy, likely around the age of 5 or 6, sits on a shiny bicycle with training wheels, his small hands grasping tightly onto the handlebars as he begins to pedal for the very first time. Standing behind him, offering support and guidance, is a patient adult, probably his father or older sibling, who holds onto the back of the bike seat to steady it. The scene is set in a quiet suburban neighborhood on a sunny afternoon, with a few trees lining the sidewalk and a gentle breeze rustling through their leaves.",
