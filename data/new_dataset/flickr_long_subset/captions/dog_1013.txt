Two playful dogs are running together in a lush green meadow, their joyful yips filling the air as they chase each other around a cluster of wildflowers. The black and white dog, with its distinctive markings, is slightly larger than its brown companion, but they're both moving at a frantic pace, their paws pounding against the soft earth. As they run, the warm sunlight catches the grass, casting a serene glow over the entire scene.
