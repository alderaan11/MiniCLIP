A young boy, dressed in casual clothing, sits atop his bicycle as he takes a break on the path, his small legs dangling off the ground. The red helmet that protects his head from any potential harm catches the sunlight and adds a pop of color to the scene. Nearby, the patterned path stretches out, providing a safe route for him to ride and explore.
