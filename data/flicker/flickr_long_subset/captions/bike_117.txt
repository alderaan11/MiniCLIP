A cyclist wearing blue and yellow lycra pedals down a winding forest path, the sun casting dappled shadows on the ground beneath her wheels as she picks up speed. The trees, swaying gently in the breeze, provide a serene backdrop to the rhythmic motion of her ride. In the distance, a hint of a wooden signpost catches her eye, marking the entrance to a nearby trailhead.
