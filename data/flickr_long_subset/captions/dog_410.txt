In the warm sunlight, two energetic dogs engage in a playful tug-of-war on the lush green lawn, their joyful barks filling the air as they chase each other in circles. The black and white dog, its fur fluffed up in excitement, lets out a high-pitched yelp as it tries to wrestle away from its brown opponent. Nearby, a few scattered leaves and twigs lie scattered on the grass, evidence of their rambunctious playtime.
