A playful brown dog runs around in the backyard, chasing after a ball as it bounces across the lawn near a tall wooden fence. The dog's tail wags excitedly as he tries to catch the ball in mid-air, his jaws snapping shut just inches from its furry surface. In the background, the afternoon sun casts a warm glow over the scene, illuminating the lush green grass and the happy pup at play.
