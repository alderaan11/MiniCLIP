A playful golden retriever stands on a sun-drenched beach, its tongue lolling out of its mouth as it gazes eagerly at a bright yellow ball lying a few feet away in the sand. The dog's tail wags excitedly, betraying its anticipation to pounce and catch the ball mid-air. As the waves gently lap at the shore behind it, the dog takes a moment to position itself for the perfect catch.
