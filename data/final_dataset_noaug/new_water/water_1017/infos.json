A brown dog wades into the river, its fur glistening in the sunlight as it searches for something to grab onto. With a joyful bark, it suddenly spots a shiny object floating nearby and pounces, its jaws closing around a yellow ring that was likely lost by someone enjoying a picnic on the opposite bank.",
