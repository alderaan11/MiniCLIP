A lone bicyclist pedals steadily down the winding road, his bike's tires crunching on the gravel beneath him as he navigates through a winter wonderland of snow-covered rocks and icy patches.

In the distance, the bicyclist's destination comes into view: a small village nestled in the mountains, its residents no doubt bracing for the arrival of winter.
