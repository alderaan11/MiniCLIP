In a sunny backyard, a brown and white dog with floppy ears excitedly chases after its favorite ball, which has bounced into a patch of soft dirt. The grass is slightly overgrown in some areas, giving the scene a relaxed, suburban feel. As the dog retrieves the ball, it looks up at its owner with an expectant glint in its eye.
