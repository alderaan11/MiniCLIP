A cyclist, dressed in a vibrant green jersey, pedaled furiously down the winding road as they chased after their friends who were scattered across the peloton. The sunlight caught the ripples on the rider's helmet and cast long shadows behind them as they gained speed. In the distance, a few spectators stood at the side of the road, cheering on the riders as they approached a sharp bend.
