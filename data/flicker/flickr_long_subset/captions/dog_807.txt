A playful black and white dog, its fur fluffed up by the wind, runs joyfully across a lush green lawn, its paws barely touching the ground as it sprints with unbridled energy. In the distance, a few scattered leaves can be seen drifting lazily to the ground, blown by the gentle breeze that rustles through the tall blades of grass. A sunny sky above casts a warm glow over the scene, illuminating the dog's happy expression.
