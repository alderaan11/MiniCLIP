The cyclist, clad in a pair of worn jeans and a faded t-shirt, pedaled steadily down the sidewalk, their red helmet visible from a distance as they navigated through the morning rush hour traffic. The pavement was lined with tall trees, casting dappled shadows on the ground beneath. As they approached the corner, a pedestrian stepped out onto the crosswalk, forcing the cyclist to slow and weave around them.
