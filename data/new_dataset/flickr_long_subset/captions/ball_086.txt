A group of adults, clad in thick winter jackets and hats, engage in a playful game on a chilly day. They take turns swinging brooms at a small yellow ball that bounces across the ground, their laughter and shouts carrying through the crisp air. Nearby, a black dog watches with interest, its tail wagging gently as it observes the commotion.
