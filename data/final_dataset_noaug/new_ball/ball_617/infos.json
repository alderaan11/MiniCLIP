The sun glints off the ripples in the water as the dog splashes and snatches the ball mid-air, momentarily holding it triumphantly between its jaws before bounding out of the pool with its prize. In the distance, a few trees lean over the edge of the pool, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze.",
