A young girl sits on the edge of a wooden table, her head bent over a white plastic bucket as she cools off from the warm summer sun. A few beads of water trickle down her forehead, and a small puddle forms at the bottom of the bucket. The scene is set against a backdrop of a garden or yard, with lush greenery visible in the background.
