A man on a three-wheeled vehicle, often used by seniors or people with mobility issues due to its stability and balance, loses control while riding it down a gentle slope. The man's feet are lifted off the ground as he falls onto his right side, indicating a momentary loss of balance. A nearby fence or railing serves as a warning about the hazardous terrain ahead.
