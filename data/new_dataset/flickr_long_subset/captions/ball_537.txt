A group of men in black tactical gear are scattered across the dense jungle terrain, each armed with paintball markers and a determined look on their faces. In the distance, a brightly colored "hit" marker lies where one player had previously fallen victim to an opponent's marksmanship. Amidst the chaos, a lone figure sprints towards cover behind a large tree, trying to avoid taking any more hits from his opponents in the intense game of paintball.
