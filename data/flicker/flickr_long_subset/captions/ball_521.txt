A group of rambunctious boys are gathered in the entrance hall, laughing and shouting as they chase after a ball that has been kicked towards the large wooden door at the far end of the room. The door, adorned with intricate carvings, stands imposingly against the wall, its surface worn smooth by years of use. One of the boys, his eyes shining with excitement, makes a last-ditch attempt to kick the ball back into play before it rolls under the door and disappears from view.
