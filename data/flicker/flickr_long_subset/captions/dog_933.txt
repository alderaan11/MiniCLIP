A playful black dog has sprawled out on its back in a lush green meadow, its fur blending with the vibrant blades of grass as it basks in the warm sunlight. A few scattered wildflowers sway gently in the breeze around its relaxed form, their colorful petals dancing above its sleek coat. In the distance, a tree stands sentinel, its leafy branches stretching towards the sky like a natural canopy.
