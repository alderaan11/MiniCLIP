The dog, a golden retriever mix, is sitting on its back paws in the passenger seat of a worn sedan, panting heavily as it gazes out the window at the sweltering summer afternoon landscape passing by outside. Its tongue lolls lazily from its mouth, and a faint sheen of sweat glistens on its fur. The air inside the car is thick with heat and dog hair.
