A young light-colored dog, its fur glistening in the sunlight, runs enthusiastically along the shoreline, its paws kicking up small waves as it chases after a seagull that has flown too close to the water's edge. The sound of gentle lapping and playful barking fills the air as the dog frolics in the shallows, completely carefree. A beach umbrella stands nearby, providing some shade for its owner who is watching with a smile on their face.
