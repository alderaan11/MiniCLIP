A sunny day at the backyard, with a small paddling pool filled to just the right level for splashing fun. The boy, wearing his favorite red shorts, takes a running jump and lands with a giggle in the cool water, sending droplets flying everywhere. His parents sit nearby on a patio set, keeping a watchful eye while they enjoy their afternoon coffee.
