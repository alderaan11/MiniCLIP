A serene winter scene unfolds near a frozen lake, where a brown and white dog has just launched itself over a fallen log, its paws barely clearing the surface of the icy water as it bounds through the snow-covered landscape. The sound of the dog's joyful yelp echoes across the stillness, accompanied by the gentle lapping of the water against the shore. In the distance, a few bare trees stand sentinel along the lake's edge, their branches etched against the pale blue sky like delicate pen and ink drawings.
