A lone cyclist navigates a winding forest path, their bike's tires kicking up small rocks as they pick up speed through the dense woodland. The surrounding trees, a mix of deciduous and evergreen species, form a vibrant canopy above, filtering dappled sunlight onto the trail below. A faint mist rises from the forest floor, adding an air of mystery to the serene scene.
