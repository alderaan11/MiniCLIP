A rugged off-road trail winds its way through a dense forest, the trees towering above as a lone biker navigates the muddy terrain with ease. The bike's red frame and seat glisten with raindrops, while its tires churn up clouds of dirt with each rotation. In the background, sunlight filters through the canopy above, casting dappled shadows on the forest floor.
