A playful black dog is leaping through a serene pond, its tail wagging wildly as it chases after a floating stick. The sun casts a warm glow on the water's surface, creating a gentle ripple effect from the dog's splash. As the dog swims back to retrieve the stick, it momentarily leaves behind a trail of tiny droplets that dance on the water's edge.
