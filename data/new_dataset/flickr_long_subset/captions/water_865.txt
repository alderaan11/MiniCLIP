"A golden retriever bursts out of a crystal-clear creek, shaking off the cool water and sending droplets flying in all directions as it leaps onto the sun-drenched riverbank. The sunlight catches the mist rising from the creek's surface, creating a miniature rainbow that adds to the scene's vibrant atmosphere. In the distance, the gentle curve of the stream disappears into the surrounding lush greenery."
