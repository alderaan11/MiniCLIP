The boy, wearing his favorite soccer jersey, is kicking a red and white striped ball across the polished hardwood floor of his living room. The room is filled with posters of his favorite sports teams, and a few of his toys are scattered around the space, including a stack of Lego blocks on the coffee table. A large window behind him lets in a flood of sunlight, casting a warm glow over the scene.
