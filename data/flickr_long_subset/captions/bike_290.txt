A group of runners, their faces set in determined expressions, pounded the pavement as they rounded the final corner of the park's running trail. In the distance, a biker zoomed past them, pedaling furiously to keep up with the blistering pace set by the front-runner. The sound of pounding feet and screeching tires filled the air as the runners and cyclist hurtled towards the finish line.
