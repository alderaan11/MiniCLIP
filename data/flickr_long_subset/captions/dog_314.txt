A sunny afternoon in a quiet suburban park, where a man in a bright orange shirt has gathered his energetic black French poodle for a game of fetch. The dog's curly coat glistens with dew as it bounds through the grass, its tail wagging excitedly as it chases after a thrown ball. With each catch, the man beams with delight and rewards his playful companion with affectionate scratches behind the ears.
