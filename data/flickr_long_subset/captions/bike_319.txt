A skilled bicyclist, clad in protective gear, is about to launch themselves over a small wooden jump, expertly navigating the trajectory to land smoothly on the other side. Nearby, a dense bush and a worn wooden building provide a rustic backdrop for the daredevil stunt. As the rider gains speed, their bike's tires grip the dirt path, ready to absorb the impact of the landing.
