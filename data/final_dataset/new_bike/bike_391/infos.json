    "caption": "A young boy, likely around 8-10 years old, is joyfully performing a backflip off his bicycle in a suburban neighborhood. He's wearing a bright red shirt and dark blue jeans, his blonde hair flying out from under his baseball cap as he soars through the air. The bike itself appears to be a standard kid's model, with training wheels still attached, but the boy is clearly confident enough on it to attempt this thrilling stunt.",
