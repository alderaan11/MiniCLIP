A group of children are laughing and chasing each other around a small public fountain in the center of town, their joy infectious as they try to dodge the gentle spray of water shooting up from the ground. The sound of their giggles and the soft gurgle of the fountain's water feature fill the air on this sunny afternoon. As they play, the children's parents sit nearby on a bench, watching with warm smiles as their little ones have fun in the cool misty atmosphere.
