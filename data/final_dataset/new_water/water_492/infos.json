She's holding onto the edge of the pool with one hand, her toes curled over the side, as she playsfully tries to get a towel that has slipped from her grasp. The cool water ripples outward from where she's been paddling, creating a tiny wave that catches the sunlight and sends shimmering sparks dancing across the surrounding deck.",
