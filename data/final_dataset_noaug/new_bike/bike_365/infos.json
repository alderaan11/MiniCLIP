The sun casts dappled shadows on the grass as he picks up speed, performing a smooth wheelie before smoothly transitioning back to regular pedaling. A few discarded bike helmets and tools lie scattered around the area, indicating that this is a frequent training ground for the boy's cycling skills.",
