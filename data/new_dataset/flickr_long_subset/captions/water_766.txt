A serene beach setting, with a gentle wave rolling in from the ocean's horizon. In the foreground, a brown dog, its fur fluffed up by the sea breeze, picks up speed as it sprints along the sandy shoreline. The sound of seagulls fills the air as the dog chases after something, its joyful barks echoing off the water's edge.
