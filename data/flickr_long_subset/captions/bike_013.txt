A young boy, clad in a black helmet and bright red long-sleeved shirt, expertly navigates his motorbike over the rocky streambed, the wheels kicking up small sprays of water as he makes his way across.

Beyond the stream, a lush landscape unfolded, with tall trees and vibrant greenery stretching towards the horizon under a clear blue sky.
