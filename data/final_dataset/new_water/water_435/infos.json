The sun shines brightly overhead, casting a warm glow over the scene and sending a few stray strands of seaweed drifting across the surface of the water. In the distance, the sandy beach stretches out to meet the receding tide, where a handful of seagulls wheel lazily overhead, adding to the peaceful atmosphere.",
