A young bike rider has taken to the air above a makeshift ramp in a skatepark, their boarder-style bicycle soaring through the mid-air as they perform a daring trick. The ramp stretches out before them, a long, curved concrete slope that provides the perfect launchpad for this aerial stunt. A few onlookers stand nearby, cheering and snapping photos of the impressive feat.
