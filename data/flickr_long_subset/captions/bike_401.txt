The sun casts a warm glow over the quiet suburban street as a rider expertly balances his bicycle on two wheels, momentarily lifting off the sidewalk to perform a wheelie. The sound of laughter echoes through the air as he returns to solid ground, a grin spreading across his face as he continues down the path. In the background, a few pedestrians walk by, paying little attention to the display of cycling prowess unfolding before them.
