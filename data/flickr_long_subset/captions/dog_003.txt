A playful black and white dog dashes through the lush green grass of a serene garden, its tail wagging excitedly as it chases after a fluttering leaf. The sun casts dappled shadows on the lawn beneath its paws, while in the distance, the soft curves of a wooden fence blend seamlessly into the backdrop of vibrant foliage. A faint scent of freshly cut grass wafts through the air as the dog continues to frolic in the tranquil scene.
