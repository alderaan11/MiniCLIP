The big black dog, its fur fluffed up against the cold, runs through the snow-covered park with reckless abandon, its tongue lolling out of its mouth as it chases after a ball. The wind whips through its thick coat, causing its ears to flail wildly behind it. As it picks up speed, it suddenly stops and turns around, baring its teeth in a playful growl at an invisible opponent.
