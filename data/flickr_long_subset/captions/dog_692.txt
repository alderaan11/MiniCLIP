A brown dog, its fur fluffed up from excitement, is sprinting alongside a chain link fence as it chases after something on the other side. Its companion, a darker-colored dog with a more laid-back demeanor, stands nearby, watching the commotion with interest. The dogs' owners are likely nearby, shouting encouragement or trying to catch their pets before they escape through the open gate.
