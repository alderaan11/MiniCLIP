The sun beats down on its back, highlighting the joyful abandon with which it pursues some unseen target, its tail wagging wildly as it catches itself mid-leap and turns to make another attempt at catching whatever has caught its attention. In the distance, a few beachgoers can be seen laughing and cheering it on.",
