A couple enjoying a leisurely afternoon on a park bench, the woman's hand resting casually on her partner's knee as they take in the scenery around them. Nearby, their black bikes are leaning against the railing of a nearby bike rack, their sleek frames gleaming in the sunlight. The couple seems completely at ease with each other and their surroundings, taking a welcome break from their daily routine.
