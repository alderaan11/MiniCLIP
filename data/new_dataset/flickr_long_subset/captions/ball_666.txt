A lively game of catch is underway in a sun-dappled park on a crisp afternoon. A black dog, its fur glistening with dew, dashes back and forth, a ball clutched tightly in its jaws, as two smaller dogs bound eagerly behind it. The joyful scene is filled with the sound of happy barks and the rustle of leaves beneath the paws of the canine trio.
