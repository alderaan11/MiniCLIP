Two dogs, one black and sleek, the other with a fluffy coat, are engaged in a rambunctious game of chase on a crisp winter morning. The snow-covered grass glistens as they run past, their paws making tiny prints in the pristine blanket. In the background, the remnants of a recent snowfall still cling to the road, its faded lines visible beneath the fresh layer of white.
