The brown and white dog wades through the deep snow, its fur fluffed up against the cold, as it searches for a patch of untouched ground to do its business. The dog's tail wags tentatively as it sniffs the air, taking in the crisp scent of winter. In the background, a few bare trees stand out starkly against the blanket of white, their branches etched against the grey sky like delicate pen and ink drawings.
