A brown dog, its fur fluffed up in the shade of a tree, pauses mid-lick to gaze up at its owner with a tilted head. The black collar around its neck catches the sunlight as it tilts its head, seemingly puzzled by some slight anomaly on its tongue. With a final swipe of its sloppy pink tongue, it lets out a dismissive snort and returns to its grooming session, oblivious to the attention it's drawn from its human companion.
