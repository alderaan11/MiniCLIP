    "caption": "A snow-covered trail stretches out into the woods, interrupted only by the occasional boulder and the tracks of small animals in the fresh powder. A black and white dog, its fur fluffed up against the cold, is momentarily airborne as it leaps over a particularly large rock in the middle of the path. The scene is bathed in pale winter sunlight that casts long shadows across the snow.",
