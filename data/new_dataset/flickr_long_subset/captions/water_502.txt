A young boy is playfully splashing his terrier, Max, on a warm summer afternoon in their backyard. The sun beats down on the lush green grass as the boy enthusiastically uses his water gun to give Max a cooling treat, bringing out a joyful bark from the grateful dog. Water droplets glisten on the dog's fur as he eagerly opens his mouth for another squirt.
