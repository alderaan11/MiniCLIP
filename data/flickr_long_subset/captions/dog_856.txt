A playful golden retriever has managed to get its head stuck inside a festive red and green gift bag, which appears to have been left unattended on the floor of a cozy living room. The dog's owner, likely distracted by holiday preparations, seems to have momentarily forgotten about the mischievous pup. A few colorful wrapping paper scraps are scattered around the room, adding to the chaotic atmosphere.
