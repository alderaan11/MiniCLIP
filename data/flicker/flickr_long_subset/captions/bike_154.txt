A young rider, dressed in casual clothing and wearing a helmet, carefully navigates their mountain bike down a set of concrete outdoor stairs. The stairs wind down the side of a steep hill, surrounded by tall trees and lush greenery. As they pick up speed, the rider begins to execute a tricky maneuver, attempting to jump over a particularly large step in the staircase.
