The pool is surrounded by a blanket of soft, green grass, and a few colorful beach balls are scattered nearby, adding to the playful atmosphere. In the background, a patio or deck can be seen, where perhaps his family members are lounging in the shade, keeping a watchful eye on their energetic little one.",
