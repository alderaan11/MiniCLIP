In the distance, three dogs can be seen running side by side on the lush green grass, their tails wagging excitedly as they chase after a small, white ball that has been tossed into their path. The ball bounces and rolls across the lawn, leading the trio of canine friends on a joyful game of catch. As they run, the sunlight catches the blades of grass, creating a warm glow over the entire scene.
