The dog's eyes are fixed intently on something ahead, and as it approaches, its tail wagging excitedly, a small ball comes into view - a flattened rubber ball that has been carelessly kicked or thrown onto the frozen ground. The dog quickly snatches up the ball in its jaws, triumphantly prancing about with its newfound treasure as snowflakes continue to gently fall around it.",
