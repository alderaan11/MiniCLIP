A fluffy black and white terrier, its fur fluffed up in excitement, darts around the edge of a fenced yard, chasing after a curious chicken who's pecking at the grass. The dog yips with glee as it tries to corral its feathered friend back towards the safety of the coop, while the chicken clucks and flails its wings in mock distress. In the background, the sun casts a warm glow over the serene farm landscape, with a few wispy clouds drifting lazily by.
