A young boy, likely around two years old, runs excitedly in his backyard, laughing as he chases after a bright blue ball that has just bounced off the sidewalk. The sun casts a warm glow over the scene, illuminating the vibrant green grass and causing the boy's blonde curls to shine with a soft sheen. Nearby, his mother watches with a smile, her eyes following the movement of the ball as it careens through the yard.
