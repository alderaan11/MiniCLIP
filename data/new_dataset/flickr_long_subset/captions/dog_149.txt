A playful black dog, its fur fluffed up from the ocean breeze, runs swiftly across the sandy beach, its tail wagging excitedly as it chases after a seagull. The warm sunlight casts a golden glow on the scene, illuminating the grains of sand that dance around the dog's paws with each step. In the distance, the sound of waves gently lapping at the shore creates a soothing melody that seems to match the dog's carefree rhythm.
