The sound of waves gently lapping against the sand provides a soothing background noise to the scene, punctuated by the occasional excited bark from the pair as they continue their joyful game. In the distance, a few seagulls soar overhead, their cries carried on the salty air as they scan for scraps and treasures washed up by the tide.",
