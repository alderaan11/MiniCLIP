"A dirt bike soars through the air, its rider ejected from the vehicle as it flips upside down in mid-air, sending up clouds of dirt and dust. The terrain beneath is rugged and uneven, with rocks and roots protruding from the ground to add to the treacherous landscape. In the distance, a spectator or two can be seen watching the high-flying stunt, their faces tense with concern for the rider's safety."
