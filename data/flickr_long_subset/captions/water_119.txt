A sunny afternoon at the lake, where the water sparkles in shades of turquoise and blue. A playful golden retriever, its fur fluffed with excitement, leaps off the wooden dock into the calm waters below. The sound of splashing water and joyful barks fills the air as the dog paddles around, its tail wagging wildly as it chases after a ball that has slipped beneath the surface.
