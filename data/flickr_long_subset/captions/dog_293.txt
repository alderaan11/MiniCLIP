A German shepherd dog, its fur fluffed up slightly in the breeze, trots alongside its owner, a bald policeman, as they patrol through a busy city street. The officer's eyes scan the crowd with a mixture of focus and familiarity, his hand resting on the handle of his gun belt. In the background, a metal crowd control barrier stands tall, a reminder of the occasional protests that have been known to erupt in this vibrant urban area.
