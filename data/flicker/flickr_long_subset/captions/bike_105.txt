A boy wearing a blue shirt and white helmet is riding a shiny white bicycle down a tree-lined street, the warm sunlight casting a gentle glow on his face as he pedals with ease. The bike's wheels spin smoothly over the pavement, kicking up tiny clouds of dust in their wake. In the background, a few houses and a tall oak tree stand sentinel, adding to the idyllic scene.
