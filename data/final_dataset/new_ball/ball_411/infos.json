A woman, dressed in a black skirt and blue shirt with a beige vest, stands with her back to the camera, holding a ball in mid-air as if about to toss it for her energetic canine companion, who is jumping up excitedly, its paws waving wildly as it strains to catch the ball. The woman's laughter carries through the air as she prepares for another playful throw.",
