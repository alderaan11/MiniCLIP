A young boy, clad in a bright blue shirt, carefully navigates through a quiet neighborhood street on his shiny two-wheeled bicycle, his helmet securely fastened as he enjoys the warm sunshine. The wheels of the bike make gentle clicking sounds on the pavement as the boy peddles with excitement, his ponytail bouncing behind him. Nearby, a few trees stand tall, their leaves rustling softly in the breeze, adding a serene touch to the idyllic scene.
