A brown dog, its fur fluffed up in excitement, is leaping into the garden swimming pool, sending ripples through the calm water. The sunlight catches the droplets as they sparkle on the surface of the pool, creating a miniature rainbow effect. A few nearby sun loungers and a brightly colored umbrella suggest that the owner has been enjoying some relaxation time by the pool before the sudden canine splashdown.
