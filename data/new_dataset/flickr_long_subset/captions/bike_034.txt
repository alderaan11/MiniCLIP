The man in the beret pedaled his bicycle down the cobblestone street, weaving past pedestrians who stopped to glance at the colorful market stalls set up along the way. A few children played tag on the sidewalk, their laughter carrying through the crisp morning air as they chased each other towards the city square. The sun cast a warm glow over the scene, illuminating the vibrant flowers arranged in a nearby vendor's cart.
