A fluffy collie, its fur blowing in the wind, can be seen running down a long, colorful slide at a children's playground on a sunny afternoon. The dog's tail wags excitedly as it reaches the bottom of the slide and bounds off towards the nearby swings. Nearby, a group of laughing children are watching the commotion with delight.
