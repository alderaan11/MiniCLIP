A sleek black dog, its fur glistening in the sunlight filtering through the trees, bursts into a joyful leap over a weathered wooden log lying across the forest path. The log's gnarled surface and the surrounding underbrush suggest a well-used trail in this wooded area, while the dog's energetic movement hints at a playful encounter with its surroundings. Its tail wagging furiously, the dog lands smoothly on the other side of the log, seemingly unphased by the brief moment of airborne exhilaration.
