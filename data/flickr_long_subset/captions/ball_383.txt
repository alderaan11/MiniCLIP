A playful dog, its fur fluffed up for warmth, is running joyfully across the snow-covered landscape with a perfectly formed snowball clutched tightly in its mouth. The dog's tail wags excitedly as it bounds through the pristine white expanse, leaving behind a trail of footprints in the fresh powder. In the background, a few wispy trees stand sentinel, their bare branches etched against the brilliant blue winter sky.
