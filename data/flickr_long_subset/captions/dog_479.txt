A playful little white dog is running freely through the warm sandy beach, its paws leaving tiny footprints in the fine grains. The sun shines brightly overhead, casting a gentle glow over the scene as the dog frolics and explores the shore. Nearby, a few seagulls soar overhead, watching the commotion with curiosity.
