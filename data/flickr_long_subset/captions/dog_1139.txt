A brown and white dog, its fur matted in places from recent play, chews on a discarded tire it found in the backyard of a small suburban house. The sun beats down on the scene, casting long shadows behind the nearby garden gnomes and rusty gardening tools. A few scraps of paper and some old toys lie scattered about, suggesting that this is a yard where children often play.
