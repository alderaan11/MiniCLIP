A small child, likely around two years old, bends down to reach into a refreshing water fountain on a warm summer day. The fountain's gentle spray creates a soothing mist in the air as the child's tiny hands grasp for the cool water, their face tilted upwards with excitement. Nearby, a few sunbathing adults lounge on nearby benches, enjoying the peaceful atmosphere of the outdoor park.
