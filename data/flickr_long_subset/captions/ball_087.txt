A group of children are gathered on a basketball court, laughing and shouting as they take turns shooting hoops in a lively game of pickup basketball. The ball bounces and spins through the air, caught by one player after another with eager grins. The sound of squeaking sneakers and cheering crowds fills the air as the kids give it their all on this sunny afternoon.
