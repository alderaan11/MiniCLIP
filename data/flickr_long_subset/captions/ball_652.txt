A happy brown dog, its fur fluffed up against the cold, sits in the snow-covered yard with its favorite green ball firmly gripped in its jaws. The sun shines down on the scene, casting a warm glow over the winter wonderland. In the distance, a few bare trees stand tall, their branches etched against the blue sky like delicate pen and ink drawings.
