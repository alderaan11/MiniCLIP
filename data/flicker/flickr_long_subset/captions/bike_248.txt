A young boy, enthusiastically wearing a New York Mets baseball jersey, stands proudly on his shiny bike in front of a suburban house with a neatly manicured lawn and a few trees lining the sidewalk. The bright blue sky above adds to the sense of joy and freedom that comes with riding a bike on a sunny day. A few leaves from the nearby trees are scattered around the boy's feet, adding a touch of autumnal color to the scene.
