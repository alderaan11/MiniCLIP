A boy plays in the surf, laughing as he tries to catch the waves at the beach on a sunny summer day. The sound of seagulls fills the air as he paddles through the calm water, his eyes shining with excitement. Nearby, a few adults are lying on colorful towels, soaking up the sun's warm rays while keeping a watchful eye on their young child.
