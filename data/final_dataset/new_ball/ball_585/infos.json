At the center of their play, a bright yellow foam soccer ball bounced and rolled, its inflated surface catching the sunlight and sending shafts of light dancing through the blades of grass. As the dogs leapt and bounded after it, the ball seemed to lead them on an impromptu game of tag, its carefree trajectory weaving in and out of the tall stalks of the grassy terrain.",
