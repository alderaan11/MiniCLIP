In the midst of a rural African village, a young man struggles to free himself from the grasp of two stubborn cows that have pulled him into a muddy puddle after crossing a nearby river, their hooves leaving deep prints in the wet earth as onlookers gather to watch the commotion. The air is thick with the smell of damp soil and the sound of chirping birds echoes through the scene. Water droplets glisten on the man's clothes as he tries to wriggle free from the cows' relentless tug.
