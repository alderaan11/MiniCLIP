The clear blue water sparkles in the sunlight as it tumbles over the rocky edges, creating a mist that rises into the air and dances around the girl's legs as she lands back on solid ground. In the distance, the rugged terrain stretches out, with towering rock formations rising up from the river's edge to meet the sky.",
