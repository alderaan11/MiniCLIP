A playful brown dog frolics on the sun-kissed beach, its fur fluffed up by the ocean breeze as it proudly carries a bright yellow ball in its mouth. The sandy shoreline stretches out behind the dog, dotted with shells and pebbles worn smooth by the waves. Seagulls wheel overhead, their cries carried away by the sea air as they watch the dog's antics with interest.
