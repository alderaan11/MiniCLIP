The man navigates his mountain bike along the winding forest path, the trees towering above him as he picks up speed on the gentle downhill slope. The blue jacket is visible under his backpack as he pedals with ease, the rhythmic motion of his legs and the creak of the bike's wheels carrying through the stillness of the forest. In the distance, a glint of sunlight catches a patch of leaves overhead, illuminating the serene atmosphere.
