The brown dog is sprawled out on its favorite cushion, its paws splayed out to the sides as it lazily chews on a worn tennis ball. A soft green throw blanket is draped over the back of the nearby armchair, adding a pop of color to the cozy living room scene. The warm glow of sunlight streaming through the window highlights the dog's relaxed demeanor as it soaks up the afternoon sun.
