A playful black poodle is frolicking in the park, its little legs moving swiftly as it chases after a vibrant red chew toy. Its companion, a brown poodle, watches with interest from a nearby spot of sunlight, tail wagging lazily in anticipation of the game to come. The air is filled with the happy barks and joyful energy of two dogs at play.
