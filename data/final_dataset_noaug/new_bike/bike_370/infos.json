Leaves from the overhanging trees create dappled shadows on the ground beneath him, and a faint mist rises from the forest floor where the morning sun catches the dew-kissed undergrowth. The gentle creak of the bike's gears provides a soothing accompaniment to the rustle of small animals scurrying through the underbrush.",
