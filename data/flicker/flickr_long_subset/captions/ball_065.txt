The sunlight casts dappled shadows on the ground as a happy black dog carries an orange ball, its ears flapping with excitement in the autumn air. The leaves crunch beneath its paws as it trots along, the ball bouncing gently against its chest. In the distance, the faint outline of a tree branch is visible above the foliage, its leaves rustling softly in the breeze.
