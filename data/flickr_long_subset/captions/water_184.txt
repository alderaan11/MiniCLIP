A group of children were playing at the riverbank, laughing and shouting as they chased each other around the edge of the water. In the midst of their game, one boy lost his footing and was sent tumbling into the river with a splash. His friends quickly gathered to help him out, pulling him back onto dry land where he shook himself off, grinning from ear to ear.
