In the warm sunlight, a daschund playfully barks at a bubble making machine set up in the lush green grass of a park, its tongue hanging out of its mouth as it tries to chase after the colorful bubbles floating through the air. The machine is emitting a gentle hum and blowing out an endless stream of iridescent orbs that are dancing on the breeze, captivating the dog's attention and entertaining a small crowd of children playing nearby.
