A playful dog runs through the sprinklers on a warm summer afternoon, its fur fluffed up as it tries to catch the droplets of water in mid-air. The hose sprays a refreshing mist onto the dog's excited face, causing it to yelp with delight. Nearby, a smiling owner laughs and holds an umbrella to shield themselves from the spray.
