In the distance, a brightly colored \"hit\" marker lies where one player had previously fallen victim to an opponent's marksmanship. Amidst the chaos, a lone figure sprints towards cover behind a large tree, trying to avoid taking any more hits from his opponents in the intense game of paintball.",
