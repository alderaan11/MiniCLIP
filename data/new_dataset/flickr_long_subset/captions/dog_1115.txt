A fluffy brown dog, its fur fluffed up in excitement, dashes across the lush green grass of a sunny meadow, hotly pursuing a vibrant red Frisbee as it soars through the air. The warm sunlight casts long shadows behind the blades of grass, and a few scattered wildflowers sway gently in the breeze. In the distance, a few birds can be heard singing their morning songs, adding to the carefree atmosphere of this idyllic scene.
