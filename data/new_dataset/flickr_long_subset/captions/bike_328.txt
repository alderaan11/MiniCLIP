The racing motorcycle rider lies motionless on the ground, his bike having skidded to a stop just inches from him as he struggles to get back up. The fallen rider's helmet and visor lie askew on the pavement, while his bike's sleek frame bears a faint scratch from its rough landing. In the background, another rider can be seen speeding by on their own bike, oblivious to the commotion on the ground.
