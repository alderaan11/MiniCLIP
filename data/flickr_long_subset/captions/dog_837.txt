Two dogs, their fur fluffed up against the cold winter air, playfully romp through the snow-covered yard. One of them, his tongue lolling out of his mouth, proudly carries a crumpled piece of paper in his jaws, as if it's a prized treasure he's found. The other dog bounds after him, yelping with excitement as they chase each other in circles.
