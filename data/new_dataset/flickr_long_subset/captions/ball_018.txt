A young boy, dressed in a bright blue shirt, lies on his back in the lush green grass of a suburban backyard. His hands grasp tightly around a well-worn football, its white panels and black stripes visible as he gazes up at the clear sky above. A few scattered leaves from nearby trees are scattered around him, adding to the peaceful atmosphere of the summer afternoon scene.
