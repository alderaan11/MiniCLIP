Amidst the commotion, a man in a bright yellow helmet rode his bike slowly through the crowd, carefully navigating around protesters who were stepping into the street to get a better view. The cyclist's yellow bicycle stood out amidst the sea of more muted clothing and signs, but he seemed focused on getting home after a long day at work.",
