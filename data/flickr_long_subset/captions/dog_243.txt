A cheerful black and white dog, its fur fluffed up against the cold, leaps through the powdery snow in a park filled with bare trees. The winter sun casts a pale light over the scene, illuminating the dog's joyful expression as it plays freely. In the background, a few people can be seen bundled up on benches, watching the dog with warm smiles.
