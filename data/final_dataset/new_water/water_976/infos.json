The puddle stretches across most of the width of the walkway, reflecting the grey sky above and creating a miniature mirror effect. A few droplets of water sparkle on the girl's jacket as she steps out of the puddle, her smile indicating that she's more excited than annoyed by the unexpected splashing.",
