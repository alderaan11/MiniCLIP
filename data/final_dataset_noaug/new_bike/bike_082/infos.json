    "caption": "A biker, dressed in casual clothing and wearing a helmet, is performing an impressive stunt on their mountain bike by flipping it upside down while riding over a small jump on a rugged trail surrounded by dense forest. The sun casts dappled shadows on the ground below as the rider executes the trick with skill and precision, their confidence evident in their body language. In the background, several trees tower above the scene, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze.",
