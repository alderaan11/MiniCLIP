A middle-aged man with a well-groomed beard rides his bicycle down a busy street, the afternoon sun casting a warm glow over the scene as he navigates through a crowd of pedestrians. He's wearing a black shirt and faded jeans, his feet clad in scuffed sneakers. A few other cyclists can be seen weaving past each other on the road, their bells ringing out as they go about their daily commutes.
