His little sister is happily perched behind him, her eyes shining with excitement as she holds onto the handlebars and waves an umbrella to keep off the glare of the sun. As they pick up speed, their joyful laughter carries through the air, filling the peaceful atmosphere of the park on this idyllic summer day.",
