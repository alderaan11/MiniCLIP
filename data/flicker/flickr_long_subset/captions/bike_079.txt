The sun beats down on a group of cyclists as they pedal through the city streets, their bikes in perfect sync as they weave through traffic. At the front of the pack, a lone rider clad in blue and white jersey leads the charge, her muscles tensed as she pushes the pace. The sound of wheels on pavement echoes through the air, mingling with the hum of cars speeding by.
