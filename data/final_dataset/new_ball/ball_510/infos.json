The tub's edges are slightly worn from countless games of catch and toss, and a few stray balls have escaped onto the surrounding floor, where they continue to roll and bounce around. As the kids laugh and shout, their bright smiles reflect the simple happiness found in this carefree summer afternoon playtime.",
