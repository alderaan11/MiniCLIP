A lively golden retriever, its fur ruffling in the wind, springs into the air with incredible agility, its paws splayed out to their fullest extent as it attempts to snatch the brightly colored Frisbee soaring overhead. The dog's owner cheers and laughs, urging their energetic pet on as they play a game of catch in the sun-drenched backyard. A few loose leaves have been kicked up by the dog's sudden leap, swirling gently around its paws as it hangs suspended in mid-air.
