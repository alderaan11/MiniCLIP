A young boy, likely around 6-7 years old, is running down a sidewalk on a sunny afternoon, wearing a bright red shirt with blue shorts. He's laughing and shouting as he tries to evade a playful black dog that's hot on his heels, its tongue lolling out of its mouth in excitement. The dog's owner, perhaps the boy's parent or sibling, is watching from a nearby bench, smiling at the commotion.
