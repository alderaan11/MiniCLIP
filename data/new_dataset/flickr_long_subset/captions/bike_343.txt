A rider on a sleek road bike hurtles through a serene forest trail, his momentum carrying him over a rocky outcropping as he navigates a sharp turn around a tall oak tree in his path. The sudden maneuver catches him off guard, and he soars briefly above the ground before landing with a soft thud on the earth below. Leaves rustle in the breeze created by his passing, and the sound of gravel crunching beneath his tires echoes through the forest silence.
