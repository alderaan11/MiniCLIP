A young boy stands at the edge of a small, murky pond, his eyes fixed on the object in his hand as he surveys the scene before him. Beside him, a family member or caregiver carefully sorts laundry into a large bucket, gently scrubbing each item with soap and water from another container. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and fresh water, a stark contrast to the dryness of their usual surroundings.
