A playful brown and white dog, its tail wagging excitedly as it leaps over a vibrant red, yellow, and white pole, which stands upright in a lush green meadow on a sunny afternoon. The dog's joyful yelp echoes through the air as it lands safely on the other side, its paws barely touching the ground. In the background, a few trees sway gently in the breeze, their leaves rustling softly amidst the happy commotion caused by the energetic canine.
