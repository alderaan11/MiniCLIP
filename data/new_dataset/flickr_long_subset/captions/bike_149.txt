A motocross rider lies on their side in the dirt, clutching at their mangled helmet after taking a sharp turn too quickly. Nearby, another bike zooms by, its rider expertly navigating the treacherous terrain with a burst of speed and agility. The air is filled with the roar of engines and the sound of gravel crunching beneath the bikes' tires.
