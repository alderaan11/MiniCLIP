A playful white dog, its fur fluffed up from the cool water, leaps into the shallow pool to chase after a green rubber ball that has bounced off the shore. The sun glints off the ripples in the water as the dog splashes and snatches the ball mid-air, momentarily holding it triumphantly between its jaws before bounding out of the pool with its prize. In the distance, a few trees lean over the edge of the pool, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze.
