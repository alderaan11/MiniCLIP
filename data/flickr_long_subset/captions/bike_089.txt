A sunny afternoon in a quiet neighborhood, with two children enthusiastically riding their bikes on the sidewalk. A young girl, about 5 years old, balances precariously on her shiny new bicycle with training wheels, her bright pink helmet and matching streamers blowing gently in the breeze. Nearby, her older brother, around 7 years old, zooms past on his own bike, a grin spreading across his face as he shows off his skills to his little sister.
