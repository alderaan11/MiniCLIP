A boy in shorts and a t-shirt is shown mid-air, leaping over a blue garden hose that's spraying water onto the lush green grass of a suburban lawn. A little girl with pigtails stands nearby, watching the scene with a look of wonder on her face. The warm sunlight casts long shadows behind them, illuminating the vibrant colors of the outdoor setting.
