A group of boys in their school team's jerseys are engaged in a heated soccer match on a muddy wet field, kicking and dodging each other as they fight for possession of the ball. The muddy terrain makes every step slippery, but the players don't seem to mind, too focused on winning the game. One player takes a shot at goal, unleashing the ball towards the opponent's net with all his might.
