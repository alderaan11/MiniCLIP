In the warm sunlight, a rambunctious medium brown dog bursts into a playful leap, clearing the low brick wall with ease as it bounds towards the patch of dirt beyond. The surrounding garden appears well-maintained, with neat shrubs and a meandering path made of small stones leading up to the barrier. A few loose bricks lie scattered about, suggesting the dog's enthusiasm has also inspired some minor excavation work.
