A lively black and white dog, its fur fluffed up with excitement, is bounding across the lush green lawn, a rubber ball clutched tightly in its jaws as it tries to catch it mid-air.

In the background, a few scattered trees sway gently in the breeze, their leaves rustling softly amidst the commotion.
