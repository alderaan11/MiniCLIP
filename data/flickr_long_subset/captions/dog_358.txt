A small terrier, its tail wagging excitedly, is hot on the heels of its larger companion, a playful golden retriever. The two dogs are careening through a lush green park, their paws pounding against the grass as they engage in a joyful game of tag. As they chase each other, the smaller dog yips happily, while the larger one lets out a deep bark of delight.
