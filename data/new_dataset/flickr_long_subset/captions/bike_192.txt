A girl clad in a reflective jacket pedals her bike along a dimly lit street, the wheels humming softly on the pavement as she makes her way home from a late-night ride with friends. The streetlights cast long shadows behind the parked cars and buildings, creating an eerie yet peaceful atmosphere. A faint glow emanates from the nearby houses, illuminating the girl's determined face as she navigates through the quiet evening streets.
