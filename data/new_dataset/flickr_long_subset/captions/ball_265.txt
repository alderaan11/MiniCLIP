A playful dog, its fur mottled black, white, and brown, is running around in the sunshine on a warm sandy beach. Its tail wagging enthusiastically, it has just thrown a ball into the air with its mouth, which is flying through the sky in an arc before plummeting back down towards the sand. The ball itself is a vibrant green and pink color, a joyful contrast to the duller tones of the surroundings.
