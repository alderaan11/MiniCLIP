A fluffy tan dog, its curly coat fluffed up against the cold, bounds through the snow-covered backyard with joyful abandon, a stick clutched tightly in its jaws as it playfully leaps over a mound of powder. The crisp winter air carries the scent of fresh-cut grass and wood smoke from a nearby fire pit, adding to the cozy atmosphere of the scene. As the dog runs, its tail wags furiously, leaving behind a trail of disturbed snow in its wake.
