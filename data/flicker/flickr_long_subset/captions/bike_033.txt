A woman in a pink hat and navy blue coat pedals down a winding suburban street, the morning sunlight casting a warm glow on her face as she effortlessly navigates her bicycle around a curve.

In the background, a row of neatly manicured lawns stretches out, with a few residents beginning to emerge from their front doors for their daily morning routines.
