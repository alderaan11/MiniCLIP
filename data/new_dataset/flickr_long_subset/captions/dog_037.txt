A young girl sits on the sidewalk, her eyes fixed intently on a playful terrier as it wags its tail in excitement. Beside her, a woman kneels down, a warm smile spreading across her face as she reaches out to pet the dog. The scene is bathed in the soft glow of late afternoon sunlight, casting a gentle shadow over the happy group.
