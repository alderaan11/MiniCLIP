A young boy, clad in athletic wear, enthusiastically swings his baseball bat at a white sphere hurtling towards him. The ball's trajectory suggests it was pitched by another player off to the side, but unfortunately for the batter, the contact is more of a glancing blow than a solid hit. As the boy adjusts his red helmet, which seems slightly askew, he looks up with a mixture of determination and disappointment on his face.
