The sun casts a warm glow over a lush green lawn as a happy dog, its tail wagging excitedly, chases after a tennis ball that has been thrown by its owner. The ball bounces and rolls through the tall grass, leading the energetic canine on a merry chase. As it catches up to the ball, the dog proudly trots back to its owner with the prize clutched tightly in its jaws.
